Vuex is a state management library for Vue.js applications. It helps you to manage the state of your application in a centralized way.

Here are the basic concepts of Vuex:

State: The state is the single source of truth for your application. It holds the data that your components need to render.

Getters: Getters are used to retrieve data from the state. They are similar to computed properties in Vue.

Mutations: Mutations are used to change the state. They are the only way to change the state in a Vuex store.

Actions: Actions are used to commit mutations. They can also be used to perform asynchronous operations.

Modules: Vuex allows you to split your store into modules. Each module can have its own state, getters, mutations, and actions.

Store: The store is where all the state, getters, mutations, and actions are combined. You can create a store by creating an instance of the Vuex store.

Here is an example of a simple Vuex store:

Copy code
```js
import Vue from 'vue'
import Vuex from 'vuex'

Vue.use(Vuex)

export default new Vuex.Store({
  state: {
    count: 0
  },
  getters: {
    doubleCount: state => state.count * 2
  },
  mutations: {
    increment (state) {
      state.count++
    }
  },
  actions: {
    increment ({ commit }) {
      commit('increment')
    }
  }
})
```
You can then use the store in your Vue components by importing it and using the mapState, mapGetters, mapMutations and mapActions helpers.

Example code to use in vue component 
Here is an example of how you can use the Vuex store in a Vue component:

Copy code
```js
<template>
  <div>
    <p>Count: {{ count }}</p>
    <p>Double Count: {{ doubleCount }}</p>
    <button @click="increment">Increment</button>
  </div>
</template>

<script>
import { mapState, mapGetters, mapMutations } from 'vuex'

export default {
  computed: {
    ...mapState(['count']),
    ...mapGetters(['doubleCount'])
  },
  methods: {
    ...mapMutations(['increment'])
  }
}
</script>
```
In the above code, we are using the mapState helper to map the count state to a computed property. We are also using the mapGetters helper to map the doubleCount getter to a computed property.

We are also using the mapMutations helper to map the increment mutation to a method that can be called when the button is clicked.

You can also use mapActions in similar way to map actions to component methods.

In the component, you can now use the count, doubleCount, and increment properties and methods as if they were defined in the component itself.

Full code with file name
Here is an example of a full Vuex application with file names:

main.js:

Copy code
```js
import Vue from 'vue'
import App from './App.vue'
import store from './store'

Vue.config.productionTip = false

new Vue({
  store,
  render: h => h(App)
}).$mount('#app')
App.vue:

Copy code
<template>
  <div>
    <p>Count: {{ count }}</p>
    <p>Double Count: {{ doubleCount }}</p>
    <button @click="increment">Increment</button>
  </div>
</template>

<script>
import { mapState, mapGetters, mapMutations } from 'vuex'

export default {
  computed: {
    ...mapState(['count']),
    ...mapGetters(['doubleCount'])
  },
  methods: {
    ...mapMutations(['increment'])
  }
}
</script>
```
store.js:

Copy code
```js
import Vue from 'vue'
import Vuex from 'vuex'

Vue.use(Vuex)

export default new Vuex.Store({
  state: {
    count: 0
  },
  getters: {
    doubleCount: state => state.count * 2
  },
  mutations: {
    increment (state) {
      state.count++
    }
  },
  actions: {
    increment ({ commit }) {
      commit('increment')
    }
  }
})
```
In the above example, we have created a new Vue instance in main.js and passed the store to it. We also imported the App component and rendered it in the Vue instance.

In the App.vue component, we are using the mapState, mapGetters, and mapMutations helpers to access the state, getters, and mutations from the store.

In the store.js file, we have defined the state, getters, mutations and actions. This is the centralized store of the application, that can be accessed from the components.

You can also use the vue-cli to create a vue app with vuex integrated in it.

Now give me data fetching in vuex
In Vuex, data fetching is typically done in actions. Here is an example of how you can fetch data in a Vuex action and commit a mutation to update the state:

store.js:

Copy code
```js
import Vue from 'vue'
import Vuex from 'vuex'
import axios from 'axios'

Vue.use(Vuex)

export default new Vuex.Store({
  state: {
    data: []
  },
  mutations: {
    setData(state, data) {
      state.data = data
    }
  },
  actions: {
    async fetchData({ commit }) {
      const response = await axios.get('https://my-api.com/data')
      commit('setData', response.data)
    }
  }
})
```
In this example, the fetchData action is using the axios library to make a GET request to an API endpoint to fetch data. Once the data is received, it is committing the setData mutation to update the state with the received data.

You can use this action in your component like this:

Copy code
```js
<template>
  <div>
    <button @click="fetchData">Fetch Data</button>
    <ul>
      <li v-for="item in data" :key="item.id">{{ item.name }}</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
</template>

<script>
import { mapState, mapActions } from 'vuex'

export default {
  computed: {
    ...mapState(['data'])
  },
  methods: {
    ...mapActions(['fetchData'])
  },
  created() {
    this.fetchData()
  }
}
</script>
```
In this component, we are using the mapState helper to map the data state to a computed property. We are also using the mapActions helper to map the fetchData action to a method that can be called when the button is clicked.

You can also call this method in the component's life cycle hook 'created' or 'mounted' to fetch data as soon as component is loaded.

It's a best practice to handle errors in the action and show a feedback to user using vue component or vuex mutation.
